DESCRIPTION

    schema as the application's user management system.

METHODS
  authorize
    Validates a user against the defined DBIx::Class schema using the
    supplied arguments and configuration file options.

CONFIGURATION
    Minimal example:

        plugins:
          DBIC:
            Auth:
              dsn: "dbi:SQLite:dbname=./foo.db"
          Auth::RBAC:
            credentials:
              class: DBIC

    The following config options are avaialable:

    handle
        The handle of the Dancer::Plugin::DBIC schema to use. Only needed if
        you have more than one schema defined.

    user_moniker
        The moniker for the result source which holds your users. Default
        "User".

    login_field
        The name of the field that the login name is stored in. Default
        "login".

    password_field
        The name of the field that the password is stored in. Default
        "password".

    password_type
        This sets the password type. In order for the password module to
        verify the plaintext password passed in, it must be told what format
        the password will be in when it is retreived from the user object.
        The supported options are:

        clear
            The password is stored in clear text and will be compared
            directly. This is the default.

        self_check
            The password will be passed to the "check_password()" method of
            the user object.

    id_field
        The name of the field that the user id is stored in. Default "id".

    name_field
        The name of the field that the user's name is stored in. Default
        "name".

    role_relation
        The name of the relationship to get the roles of a user. Default
        "roles". Set to "undef" if you're not using roles.

    role_name_field
        The name of the field on the role object that the role name is
        stored in. Default "name".
